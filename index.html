        <h4 class="card-title">More on the death of 39 migrants on the way to the UK.</h4>
        <ul><strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
          <li><p class="card-text">The world was shocked by the discovery of 39 dead bodies in a refrigerated lorry in Essex, London on Wednesday. The driver of the lorry at the time, Maurice Robinson(25), has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, as well as other charges such as conspiracy to traffic people.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The victims are now believed to be Chinese and Vietnamese nationals. Todays issue aims to give context to the extreme poverty that people around the world live in, so that people can understand why these victims of human trafficking decided to make this perilous journey.</p></li><br>
          <li><p class="card-text"> In Vietnam, 8 million people live on less than $3.20 a day, in China over 100 million people live on less than this. </p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The minimum wage in Britain, for context, is $10.50 an hour. The average daily wage is $103.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">In China, 500 million people live on less that $5.50 a day, and 43 million people live on less that $350 a year.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The World Bank in 2015 said that 10% of the global population live on less that $1.90 a day.</p></li><br>
          <li><p class="card-text">Potential migrants are often promised jobs by human traffickers, only to be forced or compelled to work for little or no money by their traffickers, or other employers, when they arrive.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Early last year, the owners of a nail bar in Bath were arrested after they employed two Vietnamese teenagers who had been smuggled into the country in the back of a lorry. It emerged that the girls were working 60 hours a week. One was being paid about £30 a month while the second was not paid.</p></li>

        <li><p class="card-text">EU’s Chief Negotiator on Brexit Michel Barnier has said the EU27 has not yet been able to make a decision on the length of the next Brexit delay due to the ongoing debate in the UK over Boris Johnson’s demand for a general election, but has said that the 27 countries are in support of an extension.</p></li>

        <ul>
          <li><p class="card-text">An inquiry into the impeachment of US President Donald Trump was announced on 24th September by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This is all due to a phone call that President Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">In the phone call, President Trump said ‘There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great’. This call came a week after President Trump put a pause on the transfer of nearly $400 million in military aid.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">This is due to a job that Joe Biden’s son Hunter got at a Ukrainian gas company. At this time, the US government was calling for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, as they felt he wasn’t doing enough to tackle corruption.  The prosecutor then claimed that he was fired because he was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working with. This is unfounded.</p></li>   
          <li><p class="card-text">During the same time as the phone call, US diplomat Kurt Volker said on a WhatsApp message to Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the EU, ‘Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation’.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">If the Democrat-majority House Judiciary Committee sees sufficient grounds for impeachment, it will be passed to the Democrat-majority House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This doesn’t mean President Trump will be removed from office. To do that, the majority Republican Senate would have to vote for impeachment.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Two Presidents have been impeached, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, but neither were removed from office.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Head of the Inquiry Rep. Adam Schiff has decided to keep the inquiry behind closed doors, to avoid coordination between questionees. This has received criticism, and there are calls to release the transcripts of the questioning.</p></li>
