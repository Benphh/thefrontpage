        <h4 class="card-title">Turkey Offensive in Syria</h4>
        <strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">At roughly 2pm(GMT +1) Wednesday Turkish Armed Forces with the Syrian National Army (official army of the opposition during the Syrian Civil Way) launched Operation Peace Spring - their offensive into Kurdish controlled lands in the North East of Syria.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group that typically occupy mountainous lands in Turkey,Syria,Iran and Iraq that is known as Kurdistan.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said that this operation is to ‘prevent the creation of a terror corridor’ on the Turkey-Syria border, by both Kurdish militants and Islamic State.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have pledged to resist any offensive and have urged citizens to ‘resist during this delicate historical moment’.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The Kurds are key US allies in the region and currently hold in the region of 90,000 IS fighters and relatives - it hasn’t been stated yet how Turkey will hold these people.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">US President Donald Trump has said ‘Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all Isis fighters being held captive remain in prison and that Isis does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form’.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">President Donald Trump tweeted: “if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey”.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">German Foreign Office tweeted: We strongly condemn Turkish offensive in Northeast #Syria. Turkey risks further destabilization of the region & #ISIS resurgence. We call on #Turkey to end the offensive & pursue its security interests peacefully.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Guardian investigation into polluting companies.</h4>
        <strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">This article was created as part of the Polluters Project - a collaboration between the Guardian, scientist and NGO’s to investigate fossil fuels companies.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The analysis was done by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The study looks at the carbon output of companies since 1965 - this year was chosen as this was the year when the US President Lyndon Johnson, released a report by the Environmental Pollution Panel which set out the likely impact of continued fossil fuel use on global temperature.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The report has found that the Top 20 greenhouse gas emitting companies have emitted 35% of all of our greenhouse gases - the equivalent of 480 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since 1965.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The highest emitter is Saudi Aramco which has emitted 4% of all greenhouse gases since 1965. This company has been called the worlds most profitable company by Bloomberg after they found out Aramco made a profit of nearly $34 billion in the first half of 2017.</p>
        <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">It is important to note - 90% of all emissions tied to these companies are due to the use of their products by customers.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Concerns for German economy.</h4>
          <strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">Factory orders fell in Germany by 0.6% in August - which is twice the forecasted fall.</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">Output rose by 0.3% in August - after two consecutive months of falling production.</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">In the second quarter of this year, the German economy contracted by 0.1%, recent data is pointing to contraction for the third quarter - this would technically put Germany into recession. </p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">The British economy is on track to fall by 0.1% in the three months to September. The UK economy contracted in the three months leading to June.</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">These economic contraction can be partly blamed on uncertainty around China-US trade deals and Brexit.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Brexit Plans</h4>
          <strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">Brexit proposals were rejected yesterday by European Commissioners. A main sticking point was the failure of the UK government to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: ‘Brexit is something that is long term, it creates specific, serious problems, first and foremost in Ireland.’</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">It was also announced that the Uk parliament will sit on Saturday the 19th - the first time Parliament has sat on a Saturday since 1982. </p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">If the UK government is to ask the EU for an extension, it must do so by the 19th.</p>
          <p class="card-text"style="text-indent: 20px;">PM Johnson will be meeting with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today(Thursday) to try and work towards a possible deal, PM Johnson is still ‘cautiously optimistic’ he can get one.</p>
