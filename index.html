        <ul>
          <li><p class="card-text">An inquiry into the impeachment of US President Donald Trump was announced on 24th September by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This is all due to a phone call that President Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">In the phone call, President Trump said ‘There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great’. This call came a week after President Trump put a pause on the transfer of nearly $400 million in military aid.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">This is due to a job that Joe Biden’s son Hunter got at a Ukrainian gas company. At this time, the US government was calling for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, as they felt he wasn’t doing enough to tackle corruption.  The prosecutor then claimed that he was fired because he was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working with. This is unfounded.</p></li>   
          <li><p class="card-text">During the same time as the phone call, US diplomat Kurt Volker said on a WhatsApp message to Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the EU, ‘Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation’.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">If the Democrat-majority House Judiciary Committee sees sufficient grounds for impeachment, it will be passed to the Democrat-majority House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This doesn’t mean President Trump will be removed from office. To do that, the majority Republican Senate would have to vote for impeachment.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Two Presidents have been impeached, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, but neither were removed from office.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Head of the Inquiry Rep. Adam Schiff has decided to keep the inquiry behind closed doors, to avoid coordination between questionees. This has received criticism, and there are calls to release the transcripts of the questioning.</p></li>

        <li><p class="card-text">For a 5th day, hundreds of thousands have marched in Beirut, Lebanon over government plans.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">Roads have blocked with flaming tires, and schools have been closed since Thursday.</p></li>

          <ul><strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
          <li><p class="card-text">Monday had the first sitting of the Northern Irish government in over 1000 days as the DUP attempted to halt legislation that was brought to the British Parliament in Westminster in July by two Labour MP’s.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The legislation means that as of midnight Monday, abortion laws is Northern Ireland were brought to the level of England. By 31 March 2020, the government must provide abortion services. Gay marriage will be legal in Northern Ireland by Valentine’s Day.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Legislation was also brought in to begin payments to innocent victims of the Troubles.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The DUP attempted to stop the legislation passing by recalling assembly, but to do that would mean electing a speaker, which requires votes from both unionists and nationalists. At this point the SDLP nationalist left, meaning the Assembly could not be recalled.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The incumbent Speaker, DUP MLA Robin Newton, was asked by Arlene Foster to suspend these rules, but he refused.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">In Westminster, the abortion legislation passed 332-99, while the legislation on gay marriage passed 383-73.</p></li>
