      <ul><strong><p class="card-text" >The Facts Today:</p></strong>
        <li><p class="card-text">Today(Monday), MPs voted 299-70 in favour of having a general election on the 12 December. However, PM Johnson needed to secure 2/3rds of Parliament to call a general election, 434 MPs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">The EU agreed to a ‘flextension’ until the 31 January, but Britain can leave earlier if a deal is agreed in Parliament.</p></li><br>
        <li><p class="card-text">Post-Brexit trade negotiations between Britain and the EU are now due to begin in December.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">The government is due to table another motion looking for a 12 December election.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">The Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats are now due to table a motion for an election on the 9 December.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">This date is important as under the Electoral Registration and Administration Act an election requires a minimum of 25 working days between dissolution and the election date itself. That means a 9 December election would mean Parliament would dissolve on the 1 November, as opposed to 6 November.</p></li><br>
        <li><p class="card-text">The SNP and Lib Dems fear that a later date would allow the government to force through the Withdrawal Agreement with the help of Labour rebels. A 9 December election is the only chance these parties have of stopping Brexit.</p></li>
        <li><p class="card-text">SNP Westminister leader Ian Blackford has hinted that they would only support a bill if it is held under their conditions, which may include allowing 16-year-olds and European nationals to vote.</p></li>

        <ul>
          <li><p class="card-text">An inquiry into the impeachment of US President Donald Trump was announced on 24th September by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This is all due to a phone call that President Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">In the phone call, President Trump said ‘There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great’. This call came a week after President Trump put a pause on the transfer of nearly $400 million in military aid.</p></li>         
          <li><p class="card-text">This is due to a job that Joe Biden’s son Hunter got at a Ukrainian gas company. At this time, the US government was calling for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, as they felt he wasn’t doing enough to tackle corruption.  The prosecutor then claimed that he was fired because he was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working with. This is unfounded.</p></li>   
          <li><p class="card-text">During the same time as the phone call, US diplomat Kurt Volker said on a WhatsApp message to Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the EU, ‘Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation’.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">If the Democrat-majority House Judiciary Committee sees sufficient grounds for impeachment, it will be passed to the Democrat-majority House of Representatives.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">This doesn’t mean President Trump will be removed from office. To do that, the majority Republican Senate would have to vote for impeachment.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Two Presidents have been impeached, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, but neither were removed from office.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">Head of the Inquiry Rep. Adam Schiff has decided to keep the inquiry behind closed doors, to avoid coordination between questionees. This has received criticism, and there are calls to release the transcripts of the questioning.</p></li>

          <li><p class="card-text">The DUP attempted to stop the legislation passing by recalling assembly, but to do that would mean electing a speaker, which requires votes from both unionists and nationalists. At this point the SDLP nationalist left, meaning the Assembly could not be recalled.</p></li>
          <li><p class="card-text">The incumbent Speaker, DUP MLA Robin Newton, was asked by Arlene Foster to suspend these rules, but he refused.</p></li>
